# js13k-2018 - Service Keeper

This is a game made for js13k 2018 gamejam. The theme is `offline`.

It's my first participation in any gamejam.

## Big thanks to zio!

Big thanks to **Jacek "zio" Che≈Çchowski**! He created music, sounds and sprites for me to use in my game. Not only he made my game look way better than I could, but also boosted my morale a lot while I was finishing my game in hurry in last 3 days. I wish I had more time to implement them in better and prettier way, though.
